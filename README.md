We present SHARP, an approach to photorealistic view synthesis from a single image. Given a single photograph, SHARP regresses the parameters of a 3D Gaussian representation of the depicted scene. This is done in less than a second on a standard GPU via a single feedforward pass through a neural network. The 3D Gaussian representation produced by SHARP can then be rendered in real time, yielding high-resolution photorealistic images for nearby views. The representation is metric, with absolute scale, supporting metric camera movements. Experimental results demonstrate that SHARP delivers robust zero-shot generalization across datasets. It sets a new state of the art on multiple datasets, reducing LPIPS by 25–34% and DISTS by 21–43% versus the best prior model, while lowering the synthesis time by three orders of magnitude.

## Getting started

We recommend to first create a python environment:

```
conda create -n sharp python=3.13
```

Afterwards, you can install the project using

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To test the installation, run

```
sharp --help
```

## Using the CLI

To run prediction:

```
sharp predict -i /path/to/input/images -o /path/to/output/gaussians
```

The model checkpoint will be downloaded automatically on first run and cached locally at `~/.cache/torch/hub/checkpoints/`.

Alternatively, you can download the model directly:

```
wget https://ml-site.cdn-apple.com/models/sharp/sharp_2572gikvuh.pt
```

To use a manually downloaded checkpoint, specify it with the `-c` flag:

```
sharp predict -i /path/to/input/images -o /path/to/output/gaussians -c sharp_2572gikvuh.pt
```

The results will be 3D gaussian splats (3DGS) in the output folder. The 3DGS `.ply` files are compatible to various public 3DGS renderers. We follow the OpenCV coordinate convention (x right, y down, z forward). The 3DGS scene center is roughly at (0, 0, +z). When dealing with 3rdparty renderers, please scale and rotate to re-center the scene accordingly.

### Rendering trajectories (CUDA GPU only)

Additionally you can render videos with a camera trajectory. While the gaussians prediction works for all CPU, CUDA, and MPS, rendering videos via the `--render` option currently requires a CUDA GPU. The gsplat renderer takes a while to initialize at the first launch.

```
sharp predict -i /path/to/input/images -o /path/to/output/gaussians --render

# Or from the intermediate gaussians:
sharp render -i /path/to/output/gaussians -o /path/to/output/renderings
```

## DGFX training fork

This fork adds training code for SHARP in `src/sharp_train`, a Modal app in `modal_app.py`, a Hypersim prep script in `scripts/`, and the paper in `docs/paper/`. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the stage plan, where things run and the budget rules.

### Predict a splat from one image

One image in, one `.ply` Gaussian splat out, from a checkpoint we trained (written by `sharp_train.stage2.save_checkpoint`):

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m sharp_train.predict --checkpoint final.pt --image photo.jpg --out photo.ply
modal run modal_app.py --task predict --image photo.jpg --checkpoint runs/<run>/checkpoints/final.pt --out photo.ply
PYTHONPATH=src python -m sharp_train.predict --check --image data/teaser.jpg
```

Our checkpoints hold only the trained weights. The frozen monodepth backbone comes from Apple's checkpoint, which `--apple PATH` points at and which is otherwise downloaded to `/tmp/sharp-ckpts`. The grid is the checkpoint's own grid unless you pass `--grid` (`--predict-grid` on Modal). `--device` defaults to `cuda`, then `mps`, then `cpu`. The focal length comes from the image EXIF, as in `sharp predict`. Weights trained from Apple's weights inherit [LICENSE_MODEL](LICENSE_MODEL): research use only. `--check` runs on CPU and is the behavioural check described in [docs/training-spec.md](docs/training-spec.md#predict-a-splat-from-one-image).

Licenses: Apple's code license ([LICENSE](LICENSE)) covers the code. Apple's weights ([LICENSE_MODEL](LICENSE_MODEL)) are for research use only, and so is anything we fine-tune from them. Hypersim is CC BY-SA 3.0.
